To find out where a line from a point intersects a plane, you can use the following steps:

1. Find the equation of the plane: This can be done using the normal vector to the plane and a point on the plane. For example, if the plane is defined by the equation ax + by + cz + d = 0, then you can find the normal vector as (a, b, c) and use a point on the plane to solve for d.

2. Find the direction vector of the line: This can be done using two points on the line. For example, if the line is defined by the points P1=(x1, y1, z1) and P2=(x2, y2, z2), then the direction vector can be calculated as d = (x2 - x1, y2 - y1, z2 - z1).

3. Determine if the line intersects the plane: To do this, you can substitute the equation of the line into the equation of the plane and solve for t. The parameter t represents the point where the line intersects the plane. If t has a real solution, then the line intersects the plane at that point.

4. Calculate the intersection point: Once you have t, you can plug it back into the equation of the line to find the actual point of intersection.

Example:

Find the point of intersection between the line passing through the point P=(1, 2, 3) and the plane defined by the equation x + 2y - z + 4 = 0.

1. Find the equation of the plane: The normal vector to the plane is (1, 2, -1), and a point on the plane can be found by setting one of the variables to zero. For example, if we set z=0, we get x + 2y + 4 = 0, which gives us the point (0, -2, 0). Using these values, we can find d by substituting into the plane equation: 0 + 2*(-2) - 0 + d = -4, so d = -2.

So the equation of the plane is x + 2y - z - 2 = 0.

2. Find the direction vector of the line: The line passes through point P=(1, 2, 3) and another point, say Q=(4, 5, 6), so the direction vector is d = (4-1, 5-2, 6-3) = (3, 3, 3).

3. Determine if the line intersects the plane: Substituting the equation of the line into the equation of the plane, we get:
x + 2y - z - 2 = 0
(1 + 3t) + 2(2+3t) - (3+3t) - 2 = 0
8t = 1

So t = 1/8, which means the line intersects the plane at t=1/8.

4. Calculate the intersection point: Plugging t=1/8 back into the equation of the line, we get:
x = 1 + 3*1/8 = 17/8
y = 2 + 2*1/8 = 17/4
z = 3 - 3*1/8 = 23/8

So the point of intersection is (17/8, 17/4, 23/8).
